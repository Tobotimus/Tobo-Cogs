Specific users can also be blacklisted and whitelisted.\n\nDisclaimer: The first streamrole cog was made by tmerc, as some of you may know. This cog was written completely from the ground up by myself, and although I was unaware he had written a similar cog already, he should be given credit for coming up with the idea first.",
