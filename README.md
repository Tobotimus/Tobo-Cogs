# Contributing

I love new Issues and Pull Requests! If you think something needs to change about a cog, open an issue describing what you'd like to change.

If you feel that you can make changes yourself, I'd appreciate it if you opened the issue anyway, so we can discuss it, then you're welcome to open a pull request. We can also discuss it in the support channel linked above if you prefer.

You're also welcome to fork and modify the cogs, as long as the [license](LICENSE) is adhered to. However, being an open source project, it's nice when your enhancements and improvements get shared with the community.
